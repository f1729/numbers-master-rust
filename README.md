# Numbers Master 

A simple Rust CLI game


## Try to guess the mistery number!

Choose the level and start typing your guess, but be aware that you only have 10s.
        
### What are "hits" and "blows"?
- hits means that you've correctly guessed a digit in the correct position
- blows means that you've guessed a digit correctly but in the wrong position.
        
Keep guessing until you get it right before time runs out!
